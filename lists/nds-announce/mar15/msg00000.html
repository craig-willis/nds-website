<pre>Members of the NDS Community:-

The transition from interim to ongoing governance for the National 
Data Service continues to move forward. Please find attached a copy of 
the charter, which has been updated in a few respects since the last 
meeting, reviewed by the interim Steering Committee, and will be 
formally presented for adjustment and approval as an ongoing 
(non-interim) charter at the March 25-27 NDS meeting in Austin, Texas.

In advance of the meeting, under the interim charter, we are inviting 
nominations for the regular (non-interim) NDS Steering Committee. &#xC2;All 
nominations are &#xE2;at large&#xE2; and then at the first meeting of Steering 
Committee the elected members will designate a chair, vice chair, 
recording secretary and four at large members. &#xC2;

Although I agreed to serve on the Interim Steering Committee to assist 
in the launch, I am recusing myself from this election &#xC2;so that I can 
continue to serve as a facilitator for this effort. &#xC2;

As additional information, the membership of the interim steering 
committee and the executive committee are listed below. &#xC2;All of these 
people can be nominated and any others you consider appropriate.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and nominations (self 
nominations and multiple nominations are welcome). &#xC2;

Please send nominations your nominations info@nationaldataservice.org.
