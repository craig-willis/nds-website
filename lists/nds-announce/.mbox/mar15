Members of the NDS Community:-

The transition from interim to ongoing governance for the National 
Data Service continues to move forward. Please find attached a copy of 
the charter, which has been updated in a few respects since the last 
meeting, reviewed by the interim Steering Committee, and will be 
formally presented for adjustment and approval as an ongoing 
(non-interim) charter at the March 25-27 NDS meeting in Austin, Texas.

In advance of the meeting, under the interim charter, we are inviting 
nominations for the regular (non-interim) NDS Steering Committee.  All 
nominations are “at large” and then at the first meeting of Steering 
Committee the elected members will designate a chair, vice chair, 
recording secretary and four at large members.  

Although I agreed to serve on the Interim Steering Committee to assist 
in the launch, I am recusing myself from this election  so that I can 
continue to serve as a facilitator for this effort.  

As additional information, the membership of the interim steering 
committee and the executive committee are listed below.  All of these 
people can be nominated and any others you consider appropriate.

Thank you in advance for your consideration and nominations (self 
nominations and multiple nominations are welcome).  

Please send nominations your nominations info@nationaldataservice.org.

Dear NDS consortium developers,

One of the interesting additions to the National Data Service 
Consortium Workshop this time is a tutorial on NDS Labs which will 
happen on Wednesday, March 25, during our small groups day, from 10am 
to 12 noon.  In the afternoon, we'll encourage participants to 
experiment in the labs environment, and we hope to have some informal 
demonstrations.  

During the tutorial, you'll learn:
   o  how to access Labs through the Openstack portal
   o  the basics of Docker containers and Docker-ized applications
   o  how to use Labs storage and existing data tools
   o  how launch to launch a cluster of machines running services

A box lunch will be available for participants.  There is no extra 
charge to participate.  To sign up for the tutorial
https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/8497487

If you have any questions, please send them to 
info@nationaldataservice.org.  

Remember to register for the meeting at https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/7222716.
More information about the meeting can be gotten at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/events/NDS3/.  

cheers,
Ray

Hello NDS consortium members,

I hope you have NDS3, the 3rd NDS Consortium Workshop, on your 
calendar.  As we've mentioned, we've added Small Groups Day to the 
meeting schedule on Wednesday, March 25, the day before the plenary 
opening.  This is a chance for small collaborations, pilot projects, 
and committees to meet face to face.  We're making several rooms 
available to host these meetings.  

This space is being made available for either existing teams/projects 
or new ones.  That is, if you would like to start a discussion group 
to meet on that day, we would be happy to host it and help organize 
it.  

If you would like to reserve a room for your team, please contact us 
via info@nationaldataservice.org.  Please indicate:

   o  group name (or short description)
   o  desired duration
   o  estimated number of participants
   o  preferred times

As always, don't forget to register for the meeting at 
https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/7222716.
More information about the meeting can be gotten at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/events/NDS3/.  

hope to see you there,
Ray Plante
NDS Interim Project Manager

Hi NDS3 attendees,

We've been tweaking the NDS3 program a bit, and we'd like to get you 
involved.  For our second session on Thursday, we are inviting 
participants to present 4-minute lightning talks describing a use-case 
or pilot-project you would like to see NDS address.  These are 
intended to both help clarify what NDS can do as well as identify 
possible near-term activities.  Presenters can share their ideas using 
no more than 2 slides (or no slides at all).

If you have a use-case or project idea you would like to share, please 
describe it in a single paragraph and send it in an email to 
info@nationaldataservice.org.  Even if you don't give a lightning 
talk, there will be additional time to share your ideas during the 
subsequent discussion.  

If you haven't registered for NDS3, it's not too late to do so.  You 
can find your invitation at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/docs/NDS3invitation.html.

You can register at https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/7222716.

There are also spots available in our NDS Labs Tutorial happening on 
Wednesday (3/25), 10am-noon.  If you are interested, please complete 
this short form as well:  https://illinois.edu/fb/sec/8497487

we appreciate your input!
Ray
