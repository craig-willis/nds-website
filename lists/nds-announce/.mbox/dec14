Hi folks,

Here a few quick updates as we end the year:

  o  Don't forget about the Consortium RFC
  o  New consortium discussion list
  o  Looking ahead

Don't forget about the Consortium RFC
-------------------------------------

Thanks to all those who have sent your comments on the two documents, 
the Shared Vision of Success, and the Elements of an Interim Charter, 
which are intended to help us formally establish the NDS Consortium.  
If you haven't yet, it's not too late.  You can find the documents at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/rfc/ along with instructions for 
sending comments.  We'd like to hear from by Dec. 19 to ensure your 
feedback is incorporated into the next versions to be released in 
early January.  

"New" consortium discussion list
--------------------------------

To encourage more multi-way discussion of consortium matters, 
including the document RFC mentioned above, we've set up a new mailing 
list: consortium@nationaldataservice.org.  (Actually, we've 
resurrected it.)  This list is intended for discussion of 
organizational and policy issues.  (The discuss mailing list is for 
technical discussions.)

We have reset the membership to this list, so YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE to 
receive and post messages going forward.  To subscribe, either click 
on the link for joining the consortium list at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/involved.html, or send an email to 
majordomo@nationaldataservice.org with "subscribe consortium" in the 
body of the message.

Feel free to use this new list to share your thoughts on the 
Consortium documents now under RFC!

Looking Ahead
-------------

We're interested in getting a few more pilot projects running in the 
new year, and we've been working hard to get NDS Labs ready to host 
them.  Look for an announcement in early January about NDS Labs.  
We have a few more pilot projects starting to come together, some that 
will be looking for interested partners.  

Also in January, we plan to announce the final dates for our Spring 
NDS Workshop with registration opening soon after that.  

Have a restful holiday!
Ray Plante
NDS Interim Project Manager
