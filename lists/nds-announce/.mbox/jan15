Friends of NDS,

I wanted to let you know about a discussion we're getting going on the 
"discuss" mailing list about NDS Labs.  For those of you who attended in 
Rockville, we discussed the idea creating a virtual laboratory for 
prototyping NDS capabilities.  We're now working to have an initial 
version of NDS Labs available around the end of this month; however, 
there is tremendous potential for growth, and we're hoping some of you
might help guide that growth.  

You haven't missed much, yet.  To see our discussion to-date, consult
the list archive at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/lists/discuss/jan15/.  If you are
not a member of this list, we invite you to join.  Just send an email
to majordomo@nationaldataservice.org with "subscribe discuss" in the
body of the message.  

If you're not so interested in the technical stuff, look for a
follow-up announcement about the revision of our vision and initial
charter documents based on comments from the RFC; we'll discuss these
on the consortium list.  

Happy New Year, and I hope to see you on the lists,
Ray Plante
NDS Interim Project Manager

Join the Research Data Alliance at its 5th Plenary Meeting in San Diego,
California

The Research Data Alliance (RDA) is pleased to announce that the United
States will be hosting its 5th Plenary Meeting in San Diego, California from
March 9 -11, 2015, at the beautiful Paradise Point Hotel.

The RDA is an international organization that was formed in 2013 through
funding from the National Science Foundation, the European Commission and
the Australian government, with a mission to reduce barriers to data sharing
and exchange, and accelerate data driven innovation worldwide. In just two
years, RDA membership has grown to include 2,600 individuals from over 92
countries.

This 5th Plenary is open to RDA members and the public. We especially
welcome those individuals that share our core values of creating the
building blocks of common data infrastructures that can bridge disciplinary
activities under a community-driven and non-profit model. Data experts,
scientists, researchers and other professionals are encouraged to attend, as
well as students and early career professionals in industries related to the
fields of research data sharing and exchange.
