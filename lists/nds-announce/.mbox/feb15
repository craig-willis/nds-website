Hi NDS friends,

We expect that we'll see many of you at Research Data Alliance 
Plenary 5 meeting in San Diego (3/8-11/2015, www.rd-alliance.org).  We 
do want to call your attention to a special session that is 
particularly relevent to the NDS.

The Large-scale Data Projects Session (on Sat. 3/8) will address how 
to advance the goals of RDA and further increase adoption with tool 
developers and researchers in the larger context of large data 
facilities and projects.  A call for papers to present during 
this session is now open; the deadline to submit is Feb. 8.  

hope to see you there,
Ray Plante
Rob Pennington

Hey David,

Excellent.  Unfortunately, I'm not involved in the planning for that 
session; please visit the RDA website to submit.  I see that I should 
have included the URL:

https://rd-alliance.org/large-scale-data-projects-meet-rda-rda-5th-plenary-session.html

BTW, we're expecting to get together with the ComputeCanada folks 
later in the week--don't know if you are part of that.

cheers,
Ray

Dear NDS Consortium Partners,

As you may know, we've been pursuing multiple opportunities for
funding NDS activities, and I would like to tell you about one of the
latest.  The NDS Executive Committee has launched an effort to submit
to the NSF "Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Data, Networking, and Innovation"
Program (CC*DNI, http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748), 
under the DIBBs area, and we would like to invite you to participate.

This is a somewhat small program, not enough, certainly, to fund all
of the NDS as we envision it; however, it is a good program for putting
some important building blocks into place and for demonstrating how we
can operate as a community.  We would to like identify both Consortium
partners to work with as well as problem scenarios that we might work
on together.  

From our discussions with NSF, we expect that there will be a strong
emphasis on enabling science and research; thus, we especially want to
encourage participation by partners who have strong connections to 
researchers that can benefit from our activities in the near-term.
Connection to a currently funded data project will also be very
helpful; as there will not be a lot of funds to spread around, it will
help if we can leverage existing projects and activities.  

If you are interested in getting involved in this proposal, please
contact us via info@nationaldataservice.org, describing in a short
paragraph your project or community needs and a specific research
problem (or two) that we might collaborate on.  Consider what data
your community currently shares, what tools and techniques are
currently in place, and where there is room for improvement.  Problems
that apply to other communities as well would be particularly helpful.

I would also encourage open discussion of the proposal, science
scenarios, and specific project ideas on the consortium discussion list
(see http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/email_lists.html
for joining details).  Feel free to CC: your suggests to that list if
you subscribe to it.  

Finally, I'll note that I expect that some of you may be working on
your own CC*DNI proposal.  That, of course, is fine, and that should
not automatically keep you from playing a role in this one as well.
Further, if there is anything the Consortium can do to help with your
proposal, feel free to contact us via info@nationaldataservice.org.

Thanks for your continued interest in the NDS--we look forward to
hearing from you.  

cheers,
Ray Plante
Interim Project Manager

Hi friends of NDS,

As the NDS3 workshop approaches, I wanted to let you know about some
updates to our web site and some coming activity

  o  NDS3 Program and Accommadation info is now available
  o  NDS3: Small meetings and the NDS Labs Tutorial
  o  Steering Committee nominations are requested
  o  New Stakeholder Analysis survey launching

There's a lot of information we want to share, so you will be getting
additional mailings in the coming days.  For now, here's a preview...

NDS Program and Lodging info is now available
---------------------------------------------------

We've added more information about the NDS3 meeting to help you plan
your trip.  We have a more detailed overview of the program describing
the different sessions.  We have lodging information available as
well.  Visit the site at 
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/events/NDS3/.

Lost your invitiation? Find it here:
http://www.nationaldataservice.org/docs/NDS3invitation.html

NDS3: Small meetings and the NDS Labs Tutorial
----------------------------------------------

With NDS3, we've added a Small Groups Day on Wednesday, March 25,
before the plenary.  This is a chance for small teams to get together
in person.  Are you part of pilot project or coordination group?  Are
you part of an RDA working group?  You can reserve one of our small
meeting rooms for any part of the day.  Room requests can be sent to
info@nationaldataservice.org; just include your group name, the
organizers contact info, the length of time you would like the room,
and your preferred start time.  

A special feature of the Small Groups Day will be a tutorial on using
NDS Labs.  This will happen from 10am to noon on Wednesday, March 25.
In the afternoon, you'll have the chance to experiment in the Labs
environment.  More information about the tutorial will be sent out
shortly. 


Steering Committee nominations are requested
--------------------------------------------

Very soon, you'll receive an official call for nominations to the
Consortium Steering Committee.  This is called for by our new charter
(http://www.nationaldataservice.org/docs/NDS_Charter_v28.pdf).  We see
to quickly gather nominations and hold an electronic election by the
NDS3 workshop.  

New Stakeholder Analysis survey launching
-----------------------------------------

The second part of our stakeholder analysis survey is about to start.
You may have participated in last years survey which we reported at
the June Meeting in Boulder.  This gave a good representation of the
perspectives of the "friends of NDS".  This time, we will be looking
to reach out into the scientific and research user communities.  Look
for the follow-up survey announcement coming soon.  

Hope to see you in Austin!

Interim Project Manager
