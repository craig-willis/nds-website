<pre>Dear NDS Consortium Partners,

As you may know, we've been pursuing multiple opportunities for
funding NDS activities, and I would like to tell you about one of the
latest.  The NDS Executive Committee has launched an effort to submit
to the NSF &quot;Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Data, Networking, and Innovation&quot;
Program (CC*DNI, <a  href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748">http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504748</a>), 
under the DIBBs area, and we would like to invite you to participate.

This is a somewhat small program, not enough, certainly, to fund all
of the NDS as we envision it; however, it is a good program for putting
some important building blocks into place and for demonstrating how we
can operate as a community.  We would to like identify both Consortium
partners to work with as well as problem scenarios that we might work
on together.  

From our discussions with NSF, we expect that there will be a strong
emphasis on enabling science and research; thus, we especially want to
encourage participation by partners who have strong connections to 
researchers that can benefit from our activities in the near-term.
Connection to a currently funded data project will also be very
helpful; as there will not be a lot of funds to spread around, it will
help if we can leverage existing projects and activities.  

If you are interested in getting involved in this proposal, please
contact us via info@nationaldataservice.org, describing in a short
paragraph your project or community needs and a specific research
problem (or two) that we might collaborate on.  Consider what data
your community currently shares, what tools and techniques are
currently in place, and where there is room for improvement.  Problems
that apply to other communities as well would be particularly helpful.

I would also encourage open discussion of the proposal, science
scenarios, and specific project ideas on the consortium discussion list
(see <a  href="http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/email_lists.html">http://www.nationaldataservice.org/get_involved/email_lists.html</a>
for joining details).  Feel free to CC: your suggests to that list if
you subscribe to it.  

Finally, I'll note that I expect that some of you may be working on
your own CC*DNI proposal.  That, of course, is fine, and that should
not automatically keep you from playing a role in this one as well.
Further, if there is anything the Consortium can do to help with your
proposal, feel free to contact us via info@nationaldataservice.org.

Thanks for your continued interest in the NDS--we look forward to
hearing from you.  

cheers,
Ray Plante
Interim Project Manager
