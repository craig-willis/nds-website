Hi folks,

BTW, nice work everyone getting the MDF demo together for SC14 and 
then actually showing it off to folks.  We had an agressive schedule, 
but it was great to see it come together for the meeting.  As a 
result, we were able to share it with and impress a good number of our 
target audience.  Thanks to everyone!

Looking forward, I've set up a mailing list specifically for 
on-going MDF work, as you should have noticed from the automated email 
announcement.  It's a majordomo list, so feel free to invite relevant 
colleagues to subscribe in the usual way (or unsubscribe if you've had 
enough ;-).  

(To subscribe, send email to Majordomo@nationaldataservice.org, 
giving "subscribe mdf [email]", where [email] is optionally your email 
address.)

cheers,
Ray
