    <div class="moz-cite-prefix">I think what the blog post highlights,
      at least for me, is the "moving data around" piece is much more
      significant at the local scale: copying data from an instrument
      database onto local storage for analysis, copying analysis
      products derived from other data sources, putting it somewhere for
      long-term storage, while having it clearly identified and labeled
      - those seem like such simple things but surprisingly tricky to do
      consistently and reliably for the unique circumstances of actual
      experimental lab situations.<br>
      <br>
      There were a few folks I have seen at NDS meetings also at the
      CENDI/NFAIS meeting - Jane Greenberg from Drexel was there and
      spoke about Dryad (and metadata). Jim Warren from NIST was there
      also, and one or two others. A lot of the talks were about
      motivating scientists to be more open with their data - about the
      incentive structure, etc. About making it easier, focusing on what
      scientists actually need, helping them to do their jobs. All the
      federal agencies there have some sort of data policy to promote
      integrity and reproducibility - requiring "Data Management Plans"
      in funding proposals, for instance. But what researchers actually
      do still seems highly variable and generally limited.<br>
      <br>
      Two things I learned - there is a federal "Data Reference Model"
      which all the agencies are supposed to be mindful of in providing
      data and metadata:<br>
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Reference_Model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Reference_Model</a><br>
      <br>
      It's supposed to promote interoperability but it doesn't seem to
      have met with wide success (or perhaps it has? Wasn't clear from
      presentations there though).<br>
      <br>
      The other thing was - there's a new "Data Carpentry" effort to
      train scientists on being better managers of their data:<br>
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://datacarpentry.org">http://datacarpentry.org</a><br>
      - it seems to be just starting up. As with Software Carpentry it
      looks like it'll have a python/github slant - something to be
      aware of, perhaps, maybe NDS should participate somehow...<br>

        I can't speak for anyone else, but I was at SC last week and not
        at the PTO.&#xC2; How was the meeting?&#xC2; At SC there were a lot of
        really good opportunities to meet with folks and brainstorm
        ideas; I plan to send out a roundup at some point, once I've
        gotten my head screwed back on after the conference! &#xC2;:)

        <div>This blog post is pretty great.&#xC2; I think he's hit something
          really fundamental.&#xC2; A few weeks ago, David Tarboton from
          Hydroshare gave a colloquium at NCSA and he made the point
          that they hope to see adoption by the software becoming a part
          of the daily workflow.&#xC2; I think there's something really
          powerful there -- and from my perspective, I think that's an
          easier goal to reach the *smaller* the initial scope of a
          project, or aims...&#xC2; Start small, build outward, develop an
          ecosystem.</div>

                On a completely different topic - for those who were
                interested in working on a "laboratory workbench"
                prototype project, Cameron Neylon has a post today on
                exactly that problem:<br>

                He notes that there are a lot of good projects out there
                supporting research data, but " The bit that is lacking
                is often the interface onto the day to day workings of
                an experimental laboratory. Something like this system
                could be the glue-ware that brings those much more
                powerful systems into play for the average researcher."</div>
