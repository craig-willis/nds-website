    <div class="moz-cite-prefix">If NDS is to be the Interop (or NSFNet)
      to RDA's IETF, then it seems to me like the focus of NDS labs
      should be implementing and highlighting interoperability of
      implementations of data standards. For example we heard about the
      data type registry:<br>
      <br>
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://typeregistry.org/registrar/">http://typeregistry.org/registrar/</a><br>
      <br>
      and RDA proposes there be multiple registries of this sort - so
      perhaps there should be an NDS labs version of the registry, with
      applications built on top of that to link datasets to registered
      data types and illustrate the utility of those relationships (in
      discovery and analysis).<br>
      <br>
      The infrastructure ideas Matthew Turk proposes sound great - can
      we put together a data type registry as a docker container as an
      example? I also agree getting a good communications infrastructure
      in place is critical - something like "Stack Overflow" would be
      very helpful.<br>
      <br>
      But I think we should keep the focus on the data side, not just on
      putting together another cloud computing environment.<br>

      <div>Hi all,</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>John Towns suggested we write to this mailing list with our
        thoughts, and what we'd like to see in "an NDS Labs," so here
        are some (somewhat organized) thoughts, following on the
        productive discussions at the meeting last week in DC.&#xC2; I've
        tried to think through "What would *I* like to see" without
        favoring the things I'm interested in too heavily. &#xC2; &#xC2;I'd also
        emphasize that I'm just one voice and I'd really like to hear
        from others their thoughts, or feedback on what I've put below.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I'd also like to encourage you to check out <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://jujucharms.com/sidebar/">jujucharms.com/sidebar/</a>
        which is a demonstration of the Ubuntu "Juju Charm" method of
        describing and deploying.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>What I'd Like To See In NDS Labs</div>
      <div>================================</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Below I've outlined the various things that I would like to
        see in an NDS Labs first pass.&#xC2; Many of these describe abstract
        services, and support for those services, that would provide
        infrastructure for building sets of services operating in
        concert.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The entire remainder of this outline is designed such as to
        develop an NDS Labs setup that would be fully transportable,
        independent of the location or hardware running it.&#xC2; All that is
        pre-supposed is an OpenStack cluster.&#xC2; This would mean that the
        cyberinfrastructure for NDSLabs could run essentially anywhere
        -- supercomputing centers, institutional clusters, commercial
        clusters, and the like.&#xC2; However, the value-add will be in the
        place to collaborate and to explore.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I think the most important things we can provide in an
        NDSLabs infrastructure will be:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Pre-built VMs and containers, ready to spin up, and the
        ability to modify and contribute modifications to these (root
        access for individuals on their own VMs would be allowed)</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* A place to deploy these and experiment with these</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Support for integrating services</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Community infrastructure for collaboration -- maybe an
        "NDS Labs dash board" or "app store" model</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>This provides both a playground and an "incubation" method,
        to provide a gradual phasing of apps from experiment, to demo,
        to production.&#xC2; We may wish to consult with Chris Mattman or
        others with the Apache Software Foundation, as they have
        considerable experience in the area of incubation and project
        stewardship.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Base Infrastructure</div>
      <div>-------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I believe there are a few things we can build on top of:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* VMs</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Containers</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Orchestration systems</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* VM image repository</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Docker image repository</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Block storage devices (these are limited at some
        relatively small size)</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* NFS mounts of large block devices (this will require more
        effort and work, and may only be initially exposed as read-only
        to circumvent permission issues)</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Note that I am describing two separate types of execution
        models, that of the Virtual Machine (VM) similar to traditional
        cloud execution as well as the "container" (similar to docker, <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://sandstorm.io">sandstorm.io</a>,
        and so on).&#xC2; I believe that running these on OpenStack is the
        simplest way to proceed; containers may eventually be supported
        at the level of the OpenStack compute engine ("Nova") in a
        future release, but for now there are probably two modes of
        operation to explore:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Provision and execute on VMs directly using Nova</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Provision an orchestration system (kubernetes, deis,
        mesos/mesosphere, stackato) and dispatch containers within that
        system</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>This should accomodate both "full-stack" systems such as
        existing applications like Dataverse, SEAD, Medici2 and the
        like, while still allowing for rapid prototyping of new
        applications that could be suited to container-based deployment.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>To enable rapid deployment, we will provide vagrant, chef
        and/or ansible files that provision a common set of items --
        orchestration systems as well as VMs drawn from the VM image
        repository.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The workflow for VM deployment would look something like:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Build VM, upload to NDSLabs Glance</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Provision using NDSLabs vagrant, ansible or chef setup</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The workflow for container deployment would look something
        like:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Build docker image, upload to NDSLabs docker hub</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Provision set of nodes on which containers will deploy,
        using NDSLabs vagrant, ansible or chef setup, deploying a
        container orchestration system</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Deploy containers on this infrastructure</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Software Infrastructure</div>
      <div>-----------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>OpenStack and AWS both provide, or promise to provide, a set
        of services.&#xC2; Both provide these at two levels, enabling
        individual apps (run in groups of containers or VMs) to utilize
        them independently; two NDS Labs projects running at the same
        time will likely need separate instances.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>So what we will be providing are pre-configured, pre-built
        containers and VMs running these services, given some input for
        configuration.&#xC2; This will enable "clean slate" operation as well
        as isolation from other NDSLabs projects.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Event system such as RabbitMQ</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Authentication system, such as either "fake" (prepopulated
        or not) LDAP server or generic user registry supporting OAuth2,
        PAM, etc etc.&#xC2;</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Relational databases</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Non-relational databases (MongoDB / SimpleDB-like)</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Storage infrastructure and coordinators; examples would be
        Globus Online endpoints and iRODS.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Note that production systems would approach this in a
        considerably different way, and we should have a second level of
        systems available as such.&#xC2; In the case of iRODS, we may wish to
        set up an "NDSLabs" zone, which individual servers can
        federate.&#xC2; In that case, however, we would run into the issue of
        admin rights, specifying iRODS rule engine rules, and so on,
        which can be limiting.&#xC2; This may need to be considered carefully
        for later.&#xC2; For a Globus Online endpoint, we'd probably also
        want to consolidate in a single service, but I would defer on
        that topic to others more knowledgable.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Support Infrastructure</div>
      <div>----------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>In addition to developing the cyberinfrastructure that
        supports developing applications, we should provide the support
        infrastructure for particular pain points:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* How to develop horizontally scalable apps?&#xC2;</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* What is the best way to store and retrieve data?&#xC2;</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* What kind of security models are necessary?&#xC2;</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* How to implement authorization and authentication?&#xC2;</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* How to execute tests?</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>And perhaps most importantly, guidelines and in depth support
        to harden apps and increase their robustness sufficiently for
        production deployment.&#xC2; These roles would be fulfilled by
        individuals as well as the community, and they would provide a
        method of consultancy.&#xC2; This is an opportunity for industry
        connection, as well as drawing on the resources at various SC
        centers.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Community Infrastructure</div>
      <div>------------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The community support structures will be crucial to ensuring
        that NDSLabs is not simply "another academic cloud." &#xC2;NDSLabs
        *must* provide mechanisms for:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Communication</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Collaboration</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Direct technology transfer</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>For communication, having communication channels that are
        both *open* and have different levels of latency will be quite
        valuable (i.e., like we use in yt <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064">http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064</a>
        ).&#xC2; I would suggest, but am not tied to, something like:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* IRC (low-latency)</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Mailing list (<a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="mailto:discuss@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx">discuss@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</a>
        is one option, but it's perhaps not as easy as something like
        ndslabs at google groups)</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* In-person workshops or "Office Hours" via Google hangouts</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>We may also consider something like Discourse, which provides
        a nice email/webforum gateway that shares characteristics with
        Stack Overflow.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The communication channels must be populated not only by app
        developers, but experienced individuals from collaborating
        locations -- people who can provide support on issues like "How
        do I pass authentication tokens?" or "What's the best way to get
        my filesystem passed into my docker container?" or "Are there
        any VM images in glance that do [...]?" &#xC2;For questions about
        specific services (i.e., "How do I add Globus Nexus
        authentication?") individuals would probably want to go to the
        particular project mailing lists or avenues of discussion.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>We may or may not want to explore a hosted Kallithea instance
        (<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://kallithea-scm.org">kallithea-scm.org</a>),
        which could provide some interesting functionality for
        push-to-deploy workflows.&#xC2; However, at least encouraging
        individuals to utilize the existing BB/GH locations, as well as
        having some planning space or "advertising" space, would be
        nice.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Hardware and Software Necessary</div>
      <div>-------------------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Looking over what I've placed above, I think even a modest
        (but real) set of hardware and software could be quite useful.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* OpenStack cluster, perhaps 256 cores total, and connected
        to allocated storage space divided between object storage and
        block storage.&#xC2;</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Persistent docker repository</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Space in Glance (the OpenStack VM catalog) for VMs</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Pre-built or pre-configured docker images and VMs for the
        various items enumerated above</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The first three of these will need to be done at the outset;
        the fourth is the one that need neither be in place at the
        outset nor developed from scratch. &#xC2;</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
