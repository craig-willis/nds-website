I think what the blog post highlights, at least for me, is the "moving 
data around" piece is much more significant at the local scale: copying 
data from an instrument database onto local storage for analysis, 
copying analysis products derived from other data sources, putting it 
somewhere for long-term storage, while having it clearly identified and 
labeled - those seem like such simple things but surprisingly tricky to 
do consistently and reliably for the unique circumstances of actual 
experimental lab situations.

There were a few folks I have seen at NDS meetings also at the 
CENDI/NFAIS meeting - Jane Greenberg from Drexel was there and spoke 
about Dryad (and metadata). Jim Warren from NIST was there also, and one 
or two others. A lot of the talks were about motivating scientists to be 
more open with their data - about the incentive structure, etc. About 
making it easier, focusing on what scientists actually need, helping 
them to do their jobs. All the federal agencies there have some sort of 
data policy to promote integrity and reproducibility - requiring "Data 
Management Plans" in funding proposals, for instance. But what 
researchers actually do still seems highly variable and generally limited.

Two things I learned - there is a federal "Data Reference Model" which 
all the agencies are supposed to be mindful of in providing data and 
metadata:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Reference_Model

It's supposed to promote interoperability but it doesn't seem to have 
met with wide success (or perhaps it has? Wasn't clear from 
presentations there though).

The other thing was - there's a new "Data Carpentry" effort to train 
scientists on being better managers of their data:
http://datacarpentry.org
- it seems to be just starting up. As with Software Carpentry it looks 
like it'll have a python/github slant - something to be aware of, 
perhaps, maybe NDS should participate somehow...

Good point.  That's something that I've been thinking about too -- how
can the data lifecycle be made much more easy, and more transparent?
From the perspective of an NDS system, what I think might work is to
have a staging area, an ingestion system, analysis, and then
connecting all three of those in all directions.  EUDAT has taken this
approach using ownCloud, which (independently of finding out EUDAT had
done so!) we've been experimenting with deploying on an experimental
"NDS Labs" testbed.  I can only assume further pain points would be
illuminated after experimenting with this type of system.

This is great -- I didn't know about this either.

I agree completely.  I've been in touch with a few folks from data
carpentry, but not in connection with NDS.  It could be very
interesting to deploy DC on an NDS system...

Of possible interest to some of this group.

The NSF-funded CTSC project (trustedci.org) is undertaking a process
of documenting community best practices for developing reliable,
robust, and secure software, and unique challenges of NSF CI software
development projects.

 If you'd like to participate in or follow this activity, you would be
welcome to do so via the CTSC blog
(http://blog.trustedci.org/2014/12/software.html) or our Security
Discussion email list (http://trustedci.org/ctsc-email-lists/). I
won't cross-post to WSSSPE further further.

Regards,

Von Welch, CTSC PI

Hi,

I'm starting this discussion thread as a follow-up to today's blog post on
"Security for Software Cyberinfrastructure":
http://blog.trustedci.org/2014/12/software.html

Discussion on any related topics is welcome, but I'd particularly like to
ask for input on identifying unique security challenges for NSF CI
software development projects, such as those listed at
http://bit.ly/sw-ci. It seems to me that CI software projects share a lot
of challenges with other Open Source projects: geographically distributed
development teams, part-time developers, project membership changing over
time, lack of strict management hierarchy, lack of long-term
sustainability and maintenance. These challenges impact security - for
example, CI software not getting updated with security fixes/improvements
because the project funding has ended or the developer who understood that
part of the code has graduated and moved on.

As we saw with OpenSSL this year, the challenge of funding maintenance of
security-critical Open Source software is not unique to CI software. See
http://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2014/166/Financing-Crypto-Projects
for some discussion on this. The 2010 report from the NSF CI Software
Sustainability and Reusability workshop (http://hdl.handle.net/2022/6701)
gives a CI perspective on the sustainability issue.

Lastly, a note about the term "CI software". I think CI software is
software that's part of the infrastructure (or is expected to be
infrastructure in the future), in contrast to proof-of-concept demo
software or research prototypes. Though I think we all have examples of
proof-of-concept/demo/prototype software that unexpectedly ended up in
production, so the line is fuzzy. Still, I think we're not so concerned
about the security of software written and used by the same researcher,
but instead the software that's widely used by CI resource providers.

What do you think?

-Jim

Hi all,

I am at a conference where the ADS presented this:

https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-webservices-blueprint

The idea is that ADS is moving to a service-oriented architecture, and
they are looking for services to be embedded in their workflow that
would be of interest to the community.  I think it's a very powerful
idea, and one that could be inspiring to NDS!
