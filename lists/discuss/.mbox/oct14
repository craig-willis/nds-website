Hi all,

A couple of us have been working on deploying at NCSA a preliminary
architecture for the NDS, based around commonly available software and
with some homegrown development as well.  We've been taking notes
here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBRatAebX5-eQXB4qTFb5UGV0Cwy8Ppux_2RPs2ZUZY/edit#heading=h.b1qfdq9dlvv

(Please excuse the first person, that's all me...)

There are some action items in the document, and it's also able to be
commented on by anyone with the link, so feel free to do so.  Right
now, we're trying to stand up:

 * NDS Dashboard (IanT, do you want to chime in about this?)
 * Analysis launching (Kacper, feel free to share about this)
 * Authentication using first LDAP here at NCSA and soon InCommon
 * Storage backed by disk (frontend by iRODS), cloud storage (NCSA and
SDSC, fronted by SciDrive), and access to other providers (fronted by
ownCloud)
 * EZID DOI generation -- IanT has been exploring this, and we're
hoping to sync up with some folks from the UIUC library to understand
better the process and for some direct collaboration

There's some more going on as well, but I'm writing primarily to open
up what has been a somewhat insular discussion to the broader
community and to seek feedback, solicit engagement and to see where we
can take this together.  We're still in the process of getting code
online, but it will be hosted at either the bitbucket or github sites,
and we're keen to get people to explore, contribute feedback or
changes, and help out with conceptualizing.  Please don't take the
list above as "all inclusive"!

One principal goal is that whatever we develop is able to have new
components brought in with a minimum of fuss, components swapped out
with a similarly minimum of fuss, and that we aim to make something
that's (easily) deployable anywhere, not just at NCSA.

We're keen to get some feedback, either on the document, or here over email!

Thanks,

Matt

Dear Matt:

As NDS is supposed to be a collaborative project, I don't think it is appropriate to call this the "preliminary architecture for the NDS." Call it an NDS pilot, perhaps?

We are implementing (in fact, have operational) another NDS pilot based around Globus services--the Materials Data Facility. Having other parallel efforts exploring other technologies is fine, but calling it the NDS architecture disenfranchises us at Chicago and I believe is premature.

Ian.

Sure!  I agree with that, and I have changed all the locations in the
document where I've used the singular "the" to "a" or "an" -- I
thought I emphasized this in my original email, but see now that I
could have done a much better job of saying so.

I've changed the name to be "co-pilot" as well.  From what I can tell,
the MDF is progressing really well, and I (the primary author of this
document) have attempted at all times to keep interoperation with what
I know of for MDF technologies as a top priority.

A pilot--agreed.  Indeed, there are other angles on the question of 
"framework" that we're hoping to grow pilot projects around.  I would, 
in particular, highlight aspects of this that the RDA has been working

That said, we're keen to see a discussion growing on this topic.  

cheers,

You can find some high-level docs at our MDF wiki page here:
https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/NDS/Pilot%3A+Materials+Data+Facility

We're developing some more user-oriented detailed documentation now as 
part of the SC14 presentation. 

cheers,

  | Content preview:  Hi Christine and Vishu, Thank you! This is a great connection

  |    familiar than I am though) and it would be very interesting to learn more
  |    about how the various pieces fit together. [...]

Hi Christine and Vishu,

Thank you!  This is a great connection to make.  I'm somewhat familiar
with OpenTopo (I'm sure others here are more familiar than I am
though) and it would be very interesting to learn more about how the
various pieces fit together.

-Matt

Dear All,

Matt asked me to say a little about the dashboard I have been working =
on.   I saw Ed Seidel give a talk in Hannover last month and become =
interested in the NDS concept.  Since then I have been experimenting =
with the idea of using the Object reuse and exchange (OAI-ORE) Web-based =
protocol to represent a research piece, along with the associated doc, =
data, code, tools, etc,  as a Web aggregation.  So, the general =
idea/hypothesis is that this model could help expose a publication =
collection as a single entity using a standardized method through the =
Web and that different serialisations of this model can be mapped using =
Web content negotiation (e.g. HTML, XML, JSON etc) to create different =
"views" e.g. a Web landing page, a Web API, a downloadable bundle, etc, =
depending on the query. Since ORE exposes a resource map that defines =
the relationships between the content, such an API can be used to =
discover (introspect) the web aggregation and interact with it =
programmatically.

To this end, I have created a pilot Website that models ORE concepts for =
creating and displaying research publications along with the various =
resources that can be included with them.  It is written using Semantic =
UI and leverages HTML5 drag and drop to simplify the process. I would be =
happy to provide a URL to that site if anyone is interested in learning =
more, sending comments or getting involved in that aspect. =20

Thanks, all the best,

Ian

as Matt already mentioned we've been working on a remote analysis
framework. The idea behind it is to use dedicated docker[1] containers
that can be dynamically spawned closely to data itself. The fact that we
are using virtualized environment allows to easily switch underlying
analysis software. Whole process: launching python script in docker
container, monitoring job status, obtaining results, is wrapped in
lightweight microservices exposing REST API. This allows for easy cml
tools creation, as well as integrating with more sophisticated web

have gone out twice.  My apologies.)

Hi all,

John Towns suggested we write to this mailing list with our thoughts, and
what we'd like to see in "an NDS Labs," so here are some (somewhat
organized) thoughts, following on the productive discussions at the meeting
last week in DC.  I've tried to think through "What would *I* like to see"
without favoring the things I'm interested in too heavily.    I'd also
emphasize that I'm just one voice and I'd really like to hear from others
their thoughts, or feedback on what I've put below.

I'd also like to encourage you to check out jujucharms.com/sidebar/ which
is a demonstration of the Ubuntu "Juju Charm" method of describing and
deploying.

What I'd Like To See In NDS Labs
================================

Below I've outlined the various things that I would like to see in an NDS
Labs first pass.  Many of these describe abstract services, and support for
those services, that would provide infrastructure for building sets of
services operating in concert.

The entire remainder of this outline is designed such as to develop an NDS
Labs setup that would be fully transportable, independent of the location
or hardware running it.  All that is pre-supposed is an OpenStack cluster.
This would mean that the cyberinfrastructure for NDSLabs could run
essentially anywhere -- supercomputing centers, institutional clusters,
commercial clusters, and the like.  However, the value-add will be in the
place to collaborate and to explore.

I think the most important things we can provide in an NDSLabs
infrastructure will be:

 * Pre-built VMs and containers, ready to spin up, and the ability to
modify and contribute modifications to these (root access for individuals
on their own VMs would be allowed)
 * A place to deploy these and experiment with these
 * Support for integrating services
 * Community infrastructure for collaboration -- maybe an "NDS Labs dash
board" or "app store" model

This provides both a playground and an "incubation" method, to provide a
gradual phasing of apps from experiment, to demo, to production.  We may
wish to consult with Chris Mattman or others with the Apache Software
Foundation, as they have considerable experience in the area of incubation
and project stewardship.

Base Infrastructure
-------------------

I believe there are a few things we can build on top of:

 * VMs
 * Containers
 * Orchestration systems
 * VM image repository
 * Docker image repository
 * Block storage devices (these are limited at some relatively small size)
 * NFS mounts of large block devices (this will require more effort and
work, and may only be initially exposed as read-only to circumvent
permission issues)

Note that I am describing two separate types of execution models, that of
the Virtual Machine (VM) similar to traditional cloud execution as well as
the "container" (similar to docker, sandstorm.io, and so on).  I believe
that running these on OpenStack is the simplest way to proceed; containers
may eventually be supported at the level of the OpenStack compute engine
("Nova") in a future release, but for now there are probably two modes of
operation to explore:

 * Provision and execute on VMs directly using Nova
 * Provision an orchestration system (kubernetes, deis, mesos/mesosphere,
stackato) and dispatch containers within that system

This should accomodate both "full-stack" systems such as existing
applications like Dataverse, SEAD, Medici2 and the like, while still
allowing for rapid prototyping of new applications that could be suited to
container-based deployment.

To enable rapid deployment, we will provide vagrant, chef and/or ansible
files that provision a common set of items -- orchestration systems as well
as VMs drawn from the VM image repository.

The workflow for VM deployment would look something like:

 * Build VM, upload to NDSLabs Glance
 * Provision using NDSLabs vagrant, ansible or chef setup

The workflow for container deployment would look something like:

 * Build docker image, upload to NDSLabs docker hub
 * Provision set of nodes on which containers will deploy, using NDSLabs
vagrant, ansible or chef setup, deploying a container orchestration system
 * Deploy containers on this infrastructure

Software Infrastructure
-----------------------

OpenStack and AWS both provide, or promise to provide, a set of services.
Both provide these at two levels, enabling individual apps (run in groups
of containers or VMs) to utilize them independently; two NDS Labs projects
running at the same time will likely need separate instances.

So what we will be providing are pre-configured, pre-built containers and
VMs running these services, given some input for configuration.  This will
enable "clean slate" operation as well as isolation from other NDSLabs
projects.

 * Event system such as RabbitMQ
 * Authentication system, such as either "fake" (prepopulated or not) LDAP
server or generic user registry supporting OAuth2, PAM, etc etc.
 * Relational databases
 * Non-relational databases (MongoDB / SimpleDB-like)
 * Storage infrastructure and coordinators; examples would be Globus Online
endpoints and iRODS.

Note that production systems would approach this in a considerably
different way, and we should have a second level of systems available as
such.  In the case of iRODS, we may wish to set up an "NDSLabs" zone, which
individual servers can federate.  In that case, however, we would run into
the issue of admin rights, specifying iRODS rule engine rules, and so on,
which can be limiting.  This may need to be considered carefully for
later.  For a Globus Online endpoint, we'd probably also want to
consolidate in a single service, but I would defer on that topic to others
more knowledgable.

Support Infrastructure
----------------------

In addition to developing the cyberinfrastructure that supports developing
applications, we should provide the support infrastructure for particular
pain points:

 * How to develop horizontally scalable apps?
 * What is the best way to store and retrieve data?
 * What kind of security models are necessary?
 * How to implement authorization and authentication?
 * How to execute tests?

And perhaps most importantly, guidelines and in depth support to harden
apps and increase their robustness sufficiently for production deployment.
These roles would be fulfilled by individuals as well as the community, and
they would provide a method of consultancy.  This is an opportunity for
industry connection, as well as drawing on the resources at various SC
centers.

Community Infrastructure
------------------------

The community support structures will be crucial to ensuring that NDSLabs
is not simply "another academic cloud."  NDSLabs *must* provide mechanisms
for:

 * Communication
 * Collaboration
 * Direct technology transfer

For communication, having communication channels that are both *open* and
have different levels of latency will be quite valuable (i.e., like we use
in yt http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064 ).  I would suggest, but am not tied
to, something like:

 * IRC (low-latency)
 * Mailing list (discuss@nationaldataservice.org is one option, but it's
perhaps not as easy as something like ndslabs at google groups)
 * In-person workshops or "Office Hours" via Google hangouts

We may also consider something like Discourse, which provides a nice
email/webforum gateway that shares characteristics with Stack Overflow.

The communication channels must be populated not only by app developers,
but experienced individuals from collaborating locations -- people who can
provide support on issues like "How do I pass authentication tokens?" or
"What's the best way to get my filesystem passed into my docker container?"
or "Are there any VM images in glance that do [...]?"  For questions about
specific services (i.e., "How do I add Globus Nexus authentication?")
individuals would probably want to go to the particular project mailing
lists or avenues of discussion.

We may or may not want to explore a hosted Kallithea instance (
kallithea-scm.org), which could provide some interesting functionality for
push-to-deploy workflows.  However, at least encouraging individuals to
utilize the existing BB/GH locations, as well as having some planning space
or "advertising" space, would be nice.

Hardware and Software Necessary
-------------------------------

Looking over what I've placed above, I think even a modest (but real) set
of hardware and software could be quite useful.

 * OpenStack cluster, perhaps 256 cores total, and connected to allocated
storage space divided between object storage and block storage.
 * Persistent docker repository
 * Space in Glance (the OpenStack VM catalog) for VMs
 * Pre-built or pre-configured docker images and VMs for the various items
enumerated above

The first three of these will need to be done at the outset; the fourth is
the one that need neither be in place at the outset nor developed from
scratch.

If NDS is to be the Interop (or NSFNet) to RDA's IETF, then it seems to 
me like the focus of NDS labs should be implementing and highlighting 
interoperability of implementations of data standards. For example we 
heard about the data type registry:

http://typeregistry.org/registrar/

and RDA proposes there be multiple registries of this sort - so perhaps 
there should be an NDS labs version of the registry, with applications 
built on top of that to link datasets to registered data types and 
illustrate the utility of those relationships (in discovery and analysis).

The infrastructure ideas Matthew Turk proposes sound great - can we put 
together a data type registry as a docker container as an example? I 
also agree getting a good communications infrastructure in place is 
critical - something like "Stack Overflow" would be very helpful.

But I think we should keep the focus on the data side, not just on 
putting together another cloud computing environment.

    <div class="moz-cite-prefix">If NDS is to be the Interop (or NSFNet)
      to RDA's IETF, then it seems to me like the focus of NDS labs
      should be implementing and highlighting interoperability of
      implementations of data standards. For example we heard about the
      data type registry:<br>
      <br>
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://typeregistry.org/registrar/">http://typeregistry.org/registrar/</a><br>
      <br>
      and RDA proposes there be multiple registries of this sort - so
      perhaps there should be an NDS labs version of the registry, with
      applications built on top of that to link datasets to registered
      data types and illustrate the utility of those relationships (in
      discovery and analysis).<br>
      <br>
      The infrastructure ideas Matthew Turk proposes sound great - can
      we put together a data type registry as a docker container as an
      example? I also agree getting a good communications infrastructure
      in place is critical - something like "Stack Overflow" would be
      very helpful.<br>
      <br>
      But I think we should keep the focus on the data side, not just on
      putting together another cloud computing environment.<br>

      <div>Hi all,</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>John Towns suggested we write to this mailing list with our
        thoughts, and what we'd like to see in "an NDS Labs," so here
        are some (somewhat organized) thoughts, following on the
        productive discussions at the meeting last week in DC.  I've
        tried to think through "What would *I* like to see" without
        favoring the things I'm interested in too heavily.    I'd also
        emphasize that I'm just one voice and I'd really like to hear
        from others their thoughts, or feedback on what I've put below.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I'd also like to encourage you to check out <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://jujucharms.com/sidebar/">jujucharms.com/sidebar/</a>
        which is a demonstration of the Ubuntu "Juju Charm" method of
        describing and deploying.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>What I'd Like To See In NDS Labs</div>
      <div>================================</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Below I've outlined the various things that I would like to
        see in an NDS Labs first pass.  Many of these describe abstract
        services, and support for those services, that would provide
        infrastructure for building sets of services operating in
        concert.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The entire remainder of this outline is designed such as to
        develop an NDS Labs setup that would be fully transportable,
        independent of the location or hardware running it.  All that is
        pre-supposed is an OpenStack cluster.  This would mean that the
        cyberinfrastructure for NDSLabs could run essentially anywhere
        -- supercomputing centers, institutional clusters, commercial
        clusters, and the like.  However, the value-add will be in the
        place to collaborate and to explore.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I think the most important things we can provide in an
        NDSLabs infrastructure will be:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * Pre-built VMs and containers, ready to spin up, and the
        ability to modify and contribute modifications to these (root
        access for individuals on their own VMs would be allowed)</div>
      <div> * A place to deploy these and experiment with these</div>
      <div> * Support for integrating services</div>
      <div> * Community infrastructure for collaboration -- maybe an
        "NDS Labs dash board" or "app store" model</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>This provides both a playground and an "incubation" method,
        to provide a gradual phasing of apps from experiment, to demo,
        to production.  We may wish to consult with Chris Mattman or
        others with the Apache Software Foundation, as they have
        considerable experience in the area of incubation and project
        stewardship.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Base Infrastructure</div>
      <div>-------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I believe there are a few things we can build on top of:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * VMs</div>
      <div> * Containers</div>
      <div> * Orchestration systems</div>
      <div> * VM image repository</div>
      <div> * Docker image repository</div>
      <div> * Block storage devices (these are limited at some
        relatively small size)</div>
      <div> * NFS mounts of large block devices (this will require more
        effort and work, and may only be initially exposed as read-only
        to circumvent permission issues)</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Note that I am describing two separate types of execution
        models, that of the Virtual Machine (VM) similar to traditional
        cloud execution as well as the "container" (similar to docker, <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://sandstorm.io">sandstorm.io</a>,
        and so on).  I believe that running these on OpenStack is the
        simplest way to proceed; containers may eventually be supported
        at the level of the OpenStack compute engine ("Nova") in a
        future release, but for now there are probably two modes of
        operation to explore:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * Provision and execute on VMs directly using Nova</div>
      <div> * Provision an orchestration system (kubernetes, deis,
        mesos/mesosphere, stackato) and dispatch containers within that
        system</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>This should accomodate both "full-stack" systems such as
        existing applications like Dataverse, SEAD, Medici2 and the
        like, while still allowing for rapid prototyping of new
        applications that could be suited to container-based deployment.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>To enable rapid deployment, we will provide vagrant, chef
        and/or ansible files that provision a common set of items --
        orchestration systems as well as VMs drawn from the VM image
        repository.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The workflow for VM deployment would look something like:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * Build VM, upload to NDSLabs Glance</div>
      <div> * Provision using NDSLabs vagrant, ansible or chef setup</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The workflow for container deployment would look something
        like:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * Build docker image, upload to NDSLabs docker hub</div>
      <div> * Provision set of nodes on which containers will deploy,
        using NDSLabs vagrant, ansible or chef setup, deploying a
        container orchestration system</div>
      <div> * Deploy containers on this infrastructure</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Software Infrastructure</div>
      <div>-----------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>OpenStack and AWS both provide, or promise to provide, a set
        of services.  Both provide these at two levels, enabling
        individual apps (run in groups of containers or VMs) to utilize
        them independently; two NDS Labs projects running at the same
        time will likely need separate instances.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>So what we will be providing are pre-configured, pre-built
        containers and VMs running these services, given some input for
        configuration.  This will enable "clean slate" operation as well
        as isolation from other NDSLabs projects.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * Event system such as RabbitMQ</div>
      <div> * Authentication system, such as either "fake" (prepopulated
        or not) LDAP server or generic user registry supporting OAuth2,
        PAM, etc etc. </div>
      <div> * Relational databases</div>
      <div> * Non-relational databases (MongoDB / SimpleDB-like)</div>
      <div> * Storage infrastructure and coordinators; examples would be
        Globus Online endpoints and iRODS.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Note that production systems would approach this in a
        considerably different way, and we should have a second level of
        systems available as such.  In the case of iRODS, we may wish to
        set up an "NDSLabs" zone, which individual servers can
        federate.  In that case, however, we would run into the issue of
        admin rights, specifying iRODS rule engine rules, and so on,
        which can be limiting.  This may need to be considered carefully
        for later.  For a Globus Online endpoint, we'd probably also
        want to consolidate in a single service, but I would defer on
        that topic to others more knowledgable.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Support Infrastructure</div>
      <div>----------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>In addition to developing the cyberinfrastructure that
        supports developing applications, we should provide the support
        infrastructure for particular pain points:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * How to develop horizontally scalable apps? </div>
      <div> * What is the best way to store and retrieve data? </div>
      <div> * What kind of security models are necessary? </div>
      <div> * How to implement authorization and authentication? </div>
      <div> * How to execute tests?</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>And perhaps most importantly, guidelines and in depth support
        to harden apps and increase their robustness sufficiently for
        production deployment.  These roles would be fulfilled by
        individuals as well as the community, and they would provide a
        method of consultancy.  This is an opportunity for industry
        connection, as well as drawing on the resources at various SC
        centers.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Community Infrastructure</div>
      <div>------------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The community support structures will be crucial to ensuring
        that NDSLabs is not simply "another academic cloud."  NDSLabs
        *must* provide mechanisms for:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * Communication</div>
      <div> * Collaboration</div>
      <div> * Direct technology transfer</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>For communication, having communication channels that are
        both *open* and have different levels of latency will be quite
        valuable (i.e., like we use in yt <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064">http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064</a>
        ).  I would suggest, but am not tied to, something like:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * IRC (low-latency)</div>
      <div> * Mailing list (<a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="mailto:discuss@nationaldataservice.org">discuss@nationaldataservice.org</a>
        is one option, but it's perhaps not as easy as something like
        ndslabs at google groups)</div>
      <div> * In-person workshops or "Office Hours" via Google hangouts</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>We may also consider something like Discourse, which provides
        a nice email/webforum gateway that shares characteristics with
        Stack Overflow.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The communication channels must be populated not only by app
        developers, but experienced individuals from collaborating
        locations -- people who can provide support on issues like "How
        do I pass authentication tokens?" or "What's the best way to get
        my filesystem passed into my docker container?" or "Are there
        any VM images in glance that do [...]?"  For questions about
        specific services (i.e., "How do I add Globus Nexus
        authentication?") individuals would probably want to go to the
        particular project mailing lists or avenues of discussion.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>We may or may not want to explore a hosted Kallithea instance
        (<a moz-do-not-send="true" href="http://kallithea-scm.org">kallithea-scm.org</a>),
        which could provide some interesting functionality for
        push-to-deploy workflows.  However, at least encouraging
        individuals to utilize the existing BB/GH locations, as well as
        having some planning space or "advertising" space, would be
        nice.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Hardware and Software Necessary</div>
      <div>-------------------------------</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Looking over what I've placed above, I think even a modest
        (but real) set of hardware and software could be quite useful.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div> * OpenStack cluster, perhaps 256 cores total, and connected
        to allocated storage space divided between object storage and
        block storage. </div>
      <div> * Persistent docker repository</div>
      <div> * Space in Glance (the OpenStack VM catalog) for VMs</div>
      <div> * Pre-built or pre-configured docker images and VMs for the
        various items enumerated above</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>The first three of these will need to be done at the outset;
        the fourth is the one that need neither be in place at the
        outset nor developed from scratch.  </div>

  |   having a place that apps could be developed. But I think that having the DTR
  |    deployable, linking that to applications, and so on -- focusing on what we
  |    can do *beyond* just another cloud computing environment, are critical. I
  |    think it was somewhat left out of the ideas I put out there, and just proposing
  |    developing new methods of launching jobs was not my intention. Thank you
  |   for the feedback! [...]

Hi Arthur,

I absolutely agree that we should focus on the data -- my understanding of
the "NDS Labs" was that it was to sort of avoid having a bunch of
applications pre-filled out, but rather on the idea of having a place that
apps could be developed.  But I think that having the DTR deployable,
linking that to applications, and so on -- focusing on what we can do
*beyond* just another cloud computing environment, are critical.  I think
it was somewhat left out of the ideas I put out there, and just proposing
developing new methods of launching jobs was not my intention.  Thank you
for the feedback!

-Matt

    <div>If NDS is to be the Interop (or NSFNet)
      to RDA&#39;s IETF, then it seems to me like the focus of NDS labs
      should be implementing and highlighting interoperability of
      implementations of data standards. For example we heard about the
      data type registry:<br>
      <br>
      <a href=3D"http://typeregistry.org/registrar/" target=3D"_blank">http=
://typeregistry.org/registrar/</a><br>
      <br>
      and RDA proposes there be multiple registries of this sort - so
      perhaps there should be an NDS labs version of the registry, with
      applications built on top of that to link datasets to registered
      data types and illustrate the utility of those relationships (in
      discovery and analysis).<br>
      <br>
      The infrastructure ideas Matthew Turk proposes sound great - can
      we put together a data type registry as a docker container as an

      <div>The entire remainder of this outline is designed such as to

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I think the most important things we can provide in an

      <div>=C2=A0* Pre-built VMs and containers, ready to spin up, and the

      <div>Base Infrastructure</div>
      <div>-------------------</div>
      <div><br>

      <div>=C2=A0* Docker image repository</div>
      <div>=C2=A0* Block storage devices (these are limited at some

      <div>=C2=A0* NFS mounts of large block devices (this will require mor=

        to circumvent permission issues)</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Note that I am describing two separate types of execution
        models, that of the Virtual Machine (VM) similar to traditional
        cloud execution as well as the &quot;container&quot; (similar to do=
cker, <a href=3D"http://sandstorm.io" target=3D"_blank">sandstorm.io</a>,
        and so on).=C2=A0 I believe that running these on OpenStack is the
        simplest way to proceed; containers may eventually be supported
        at the level of the OpenStack compute engine (&quot;Nova&quot;) in =
a
        future release, but for now there are probably two modes of
        operation to explore:</div>

      <div>This should accomodate both &quot;full-stack&quot; systems such =
as
        existing applications like Dataverse, SEAD, Medici2 and the

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>To enable rapid deployment, we will provide vagrant, chef

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>OpenStack and AWS both provide, or promise to provide, a set
        of services.=C2=A0 Both provide these at two levels, enabling
        individual apps (run in groups of containers or VMs) to utilize
        them independently; two NDS Labs projects running at the same
        time will likely need separate instances.</div>
      <div><br>

      <div>So what we will be providing are pre-configured, pre-built

      <div>Note that production systems would approach this in a

to
        set up an &quot;NDSLabs&quot; zone, which individual servers can

I would definately like to see NDS Labs be a platform for RDA ideas.  
I hope it can also be a lab for cultivating additional RDS WG 
activity, both building on the currently deliveries and inspiring new 
ones.

It's been proposed that NDS Labs respond to requests for projects, so 
I would hope that there would be people from the RDA community 
inspired to come forward.  

That said, the NDS Labs proposal is essentially one of storage 
and compute resources and support to operate it.  Your suggestion 
(puting a registry in a docker container) helps us understand whether 
the proposed environment can serve that role.  

cheers,
Ray

I think we should go way beyond just storage and compute -- it needs
to be tied into strong community interaction, otherwise we are simply
Amazon EC2 (which, I note, has lots of public datasets already) or the
Open Science Data Cloud.  I think having strong community buy-in,
emphasizing interoperability between applications, and so on needs to
be a component.

Can you say more about the "NDS labs proposal"?

In my mind these are things that are hard for any one of us to do on our own and they all build in a reason why collective action is better than individual efforts to use other clouds, etc. I can build test suites and reference services to interact with, but with NDS Labs, I hopefully only need to supply 1/Nth as much effort to do this. Similarly with data - I can look to my project's user base for test collections (different data types, size, metadata, provenance, ...), but NDS Labs will have more breadth and there's potentially 1/Nth as much work for us to contribute to shared test data.

Etcetera. The thing I like about this type of framing is that explains why you'd come to NDS Labs and what the ground rules might be (you must be able to expose your data/metadata/events through one or more standard APIs, you should identify one or more cross-project interactions/interoperations you wish to test, you should register your 'real' data products with NDS Share, ...), as well as detailing what NDS should provide (standardized machines to run pilots, reference services, and test runs, data/service test suites, test versions of NDS Share store/retrieve services, ...). (The intent would be to be lightweight - no one should be turned away from using NDS Labs because they aren't 'tall enough', but if you really don't want to follow any of the ground rules, you might wonder if you're in the wrong place, or these become criteria for deciding on larger resource requests. Similarly, rather than NDS Labs selecting a lot of specific services it will propose and run, if groups of projects can make requests/do the work to create shared resources within NDS Labs, the labs will be agile. (If several groups want a type registry they can stand one up in NDS Labs. If a lot of projects have interest in a given service or data resource, perhaps NDS Labs has some labor to contribute to setup or maintenance...).)


Partial aside: This might be a way to rework the draft NDS vision too - NDS shares a vision with other organizations and projects with the consortium coming together to do just those things where coordination, particularly coordination around data and resources, will accelerate our collective ability to realize the vision. The NDS Labs framing above fits that and I think NDS Share could as well - we all face the issues of provisioning for large data and for the long-term and in guaranteeing researchers a state-of-the-art mix of base and advanced services for longer periods than our project lifetimes. If NDS Share became a place that data could go regardless of input system, where data would remain accessible after the input system went away, where new services and systems (production, pilot, or experimental) could interact with the data, where users could go to understand the range of capabilities available and make apples-to-apples comparisons, and where data could either stay forever or be moved at the lowest cost to future repositories, it would, with the consortium backing it, provide better answers on these issues than any of us could at a single project level...

I think we should go way beyond just storage and compute -- it needs to be tied into strong community interaction, otherwise we are simply Amazon EC2 (which, I note, has lots of public datasets already) or the Open Science Data Cloud.  I think having strong community buy-in, emphasizing interoperability between applications, and so on needs to be a component.

Can you say more about the "NDS labs proposal"?

Hi Jim,

Thanks for the ideas -- I think they identify a number of important things
that NDS Labs could provide.  In reading them over, I wonder if we could
identify some technical things that could support this vision.  I came up
with a few that I think might support this, but I'm not sure I am on the
right track.

 * Service discovery.  If there were a small number of pragmatically
defined *verbs* (eg, collect-with-OAI-ORE, receive-SWORD) or *service
names* (SEAD, or GlobusOnline, or Authenticate) that described things that
something provides, it could advertise itself.  Things like zookeeper and
etcd fleet might be able provide this information.  Then an app could,
similar to how "Rendezvous" used to claim to work, discovery what else is
available.
 * "Mixins" for developing containers or collections of containers.  i.e.,
if you're launching a bundle, if you want something that fulfills the need
to provision a new MySQL db, use this drop-in addon.  Or, a container that
connected to an event bus, or something.  I'm speculating here, but I think
that sharing the tech that performs specific functions would serve the
purposes you laid out.
 * Base images for "NDS Labs," for instance, something that includes all
the necessary bits to get going with an app that uses all the other running
services for data access, collecting, etc.
 * A few services that were provided to all apps or orchestrations running
on the NDS Labs -- for instance, an authentication system that managed
talking to Globus Nexus or InCommon and provided internal tokens that were
passed around.  Or something that was able to *name* storage locations and
manage mountpoints (e.g., iRODS, Ceph, etc)  These could be ala carte.

Now, in addition to this, of course we'd need social interactions between
different developers and groups to actually make this happen.  This is
where I think the hardest aspects of your first two points are going to
come into play.  I think identifying low-friction methods of communicating
will be key here -- and by providing the location these things can be run
(and I *hope* this will be federated, and with deployments at multiple
sites!) then technology can be transferred directly.  Do you have any
suggestions for how we can facilitate this type of interaction?

Would you be interested in experimenting with deploying on something like
Apache mesos / mesosphere?  It seems to be a pretty low-friction way of
deploying containers, and I'm rather interested in the service discovery
aspects of it.  But perhaps it's a poor fit, especially if service
discovery is not necessary.

-Matt

Hi all,

In the other thread, Arthur brought up that we don't want "just another
cloud infrastructure," which I think was really apt, and something that
deserves thought for any NDS Labs project.  So I wanted to start a couple
topics about what can be provided on top of a standard cloud infrastructure
that might be of use.

I'm wondering about discovering data services within a region, where that
region is either some subnet on a cloud provider, or even more globally
across locations.  If we are thinking about interoperability of services,
then there are probably a few verbs that could be identified as being
necessary.  If we can have services identify themselves as providing verb
endpoints, that could provide an environment for testing interop.

Kacper and I have been experimenting with this ourselves, mostly looking at
the various service discovery mechanisms that operate on docker containers
being orchestrated across machines.  Some of these do this via
introspection, and some will even set up automatic (nginx) reverse proxies
for docker containers running inside a system.  Right now it looks like
etcd is a pretty good solution for this:

https://coreos.com/docs/distributed-configuration/getting-started-with-etcd/
http://www.activestate.com/blog/2014/03/brandon-philips-explains-etcd
https://github.com/coreos/etcd

as it can allow for key/value pairs to be stored, and it's discoverable.
For instance:

http://jasonwilder.com/blog/2014/07/15/docker-service-discovery/

I think having a discussion about what we want services to be able to do is
perhaps a much bigger topic, but I wonder if this type of thing --
particularly etcd -- would be useful to any projects, and would be a good
avenue for service discovery and intertop.  Is there something else that
would be better?

-Matt

I really liked your talk about what you'd done with Epiphyte - in 
particular making hard things easy. Very impressive work. Is there some 
way to organize this by starting from the "hard" use cases NDS labs is 
trying to address, and drill down to the technology components really 
needed to make that happen? Discovery does seem likely to be a good part 
of it, but if it's based on key-value pairs (for example) how does the 
user know what keys to query, who sets the standards for those keys and 
meanings of corresponding values? Aside from knowing where exactly the 
etcd server or whatever is doing that work is. There's got to be some 
base starting point, a system that knows enough to help the user do 
things, can we work from there?

      components really needed to make that happen? Discovery does seem
      likely to be a good part of it, but if it's based on key-value
      pairs (for example) how does the user know what keys to query, who
      sets the standards for those keys and meanings of corresponding
      values? Aside from knowing where exactly the etcd server or
      whatever is doing that work is. There's got to be some base
      starting point, a system that knows enough to help the user do
      things, can we work from there?<br>

      <div>In the other thread, Arthur brought up that we don't want
        "just another cloud infrastructure," which I think was really
        apt, and something that deserves thought for any NDS Labs
        project.  So I wanted to start a couple topics about what can be
        provided on top of a standard cloud infrastructure that might be
        of use.</div>

      <div>I'm wondering about discovering data services within a
        region, where that region is either some subnet on a cloud
        provider, or even more globally across locations.  If we are
        thinking about interoperability of services, then there are
        probably a few verbs that could be identified as being
        necessary.  If we can have services identify themselves as
        providing verb endpoints, that could provide an environment for
        testing interop.</div>

      <div>Kacper and I have been experimenting with this ourselves,
        mostly looking at the various service discovery mechanisms that
        operate on docker containers being orchestrated across
        machines.  Some of these do this via introspection, and some
        will even set up automatic (nginx) reverse proxies for docker
        containers running inside a system.  Right now it looks like
        etcd is a pretty good solution for this:</div>

      <div>as it can allow for key/value pairs to be stored, and it's
        discoverable.  For instance:</div>

      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I think having a discussion about what we want services to be
        able to do is perhaps a much bigger topic, but I wonder if this
        type of thing -- particularly etcd -- would be useful to any
        projects, and would be a good avenue for service discovery and
        intertop.  Is there something else that would be better?</div>
