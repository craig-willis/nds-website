Hi Arthur,<br><br><div>Sorry it&#39;s taken me a few days to reply, but I&#39;ve been pondering your email for a while and trying to formulate a response to it.</div><div><br></div><div>I think perhaps what I&#39;ve been trying to get at in thinking about NDS Labs and trying to spur the conversation, is to figure out what&#39;s the best possible way to foster interoperability -- specifically, what can we do, now, to create an environment to explore and experiment.&#xC2; I originally thought we could do this by providing:</div><div><br></div><div>&#xC2;* Communication mechanisms</div><div>&#xC2;* Gradual growth and incubation of components that are connectable</div><div>&#xC2;* Simple start, complex end</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps, though, approaching this from &quot;service discovery&quot; is the wrong way.&#xC2; Adding more indirection, reimplementing things that have been done before -- both are tricky, like you point out, and probably are best to avoid for the time being.</div><div><br></div><div>Service discovery in general may simply be too *big* a sandbox for NDSLabs, where individual projects and instances will likely number in the handful, not the hundreds, and where the N^2 process of developing interoperability is going to be relatively small.&#xC2; If we can standardize generic k-v pairs but can&#39;t manage service discovery without them, we probably are doing something wrong! &#xC2;:)</div><div><br></div><div>So let&#39;s try what you suggested, and hammer down on what the specific, difficult technical things are that we want to do, and then figure out how to implement them.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are the things that for a &quot;next gen epiphyte&quot; I know I would want:</div><div><br></div><div>&#xC2;* What are the possible applications I can send input data to</div><div>&#xC2;* Where can the resultant data be sent</div><div>&#xC2;* Where can selections of data be obtained</div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;d also like to provide as much as possible in the simplest technology available -- which means that OAI will be a goal, but not the only conduit for data.</div><div><br></div><div>For epiphyte, we&#39;re also taking the tactic that (for now) the data is all in the form of files on disk.&#xC2; This won&#39;t work forever, but it will for the time being.&#xC2; If we were going to take those three &quot;services,&quot; I think I would want to know a host/port, and some format for the transmittance of data -- perhaps even just REST posting, or a URI to a filesystem/filesystem-like thing.&#xC2; If we had that information it might be enough to provide some degree of interop at that level, with a basis of understanding we can build more complex ideas on top of later.</div><div><br></div><div>Does that help to focus the ideas more?&#xC2; Or is this still complexity in search of need?</div><div><br></div><div>-Matt</div><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu Oct 30 2014 at 2:17:34 PM Arthur Smith &lt;<a href="mailto:apsmith@xxxxxxx">apsmith@xxxxxxx</a>&gt; wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex">

    <div>That does sound interesting. However,
      it also reminds me of RFC 1925:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925" target="_blank">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1925</a><br>
      <br>
      in particular &quot;6a - It is always possible to add another level of
      indirection.
      
      &quot; and perhaps #11 as well... Lots of wisdom in the old IETF...<br>
      <br>
      I really liked your talk about what you&#39;d done with Epiphyte - in
      particular making hard things easy. Very impressive work. Is there
      some way to organize this by starting from the &quot;hard&quot; use cases
      NDS labs is trying to address, and drill down to the technology
      components really needed to make that happen? Discovery does seem
      likely to be a good part of it, but if it&#39;s based on key-value
      pairs (for example) how does the user know what keys to query, who
      sets the standards for those keys and meanings of corresponding
      values? Aside from knowing where exactly the etcd server or
      whatever is doing that work is. There&#39;s got to be some base
      starting point, a system that knows enough to help the user do
      things, can we work from there?</div></div><div bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000"><div><br>

      <div>In the other thread, Arthur brought up that we don&#39;t want
        &quot;just another cloud infrastructure,&quot; which I think was really
        apt, and something that deserves thought for any NDS Labs
        project.&#xC2; So I wanted to start a couple topics about what can be
        provided on top of a standard cloud infrastructure that might be
        of use.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I&#39;m wondering about discovering data services within a
        region, where that region is either some subnet on a cloud
        provider, or even more globally across locations.&#xC2; If we are
        thinking about interoperability of services, then there are
        probably a few verbs that could be identified as being
        necessary.&#xC2; If we can have services identify themselves as
        providing verb endpoints, that could provide an environment for
        testing interop.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Kacper and I have been experimenting with this ourselves,
        mostly looking at the various service discovery mechanisms that
        operate on docker containers being orchestrated across
        machines.&#xC2; Some of these do this via introspection, and some
        will even set up automatic (nginx) reverse proxies for docker
        containers running inside a system.&#xC2; Right now it looks like
        etcd is a pretty good solution for this:</div>

      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>as it can allow for key/value pairs to be stored, and it&#39;s
        discoverable.&#xC2; For instance:</div>
      <div><br>

      </div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I think having a discussion about what we want services to be
        able to do is perhaps a much bigger topic, but I wonder if this
        type of thing -- particularly etcd -- would be useful to any
        projects, and would be a good avenue for service discovery and
        intertop.&#xC2; Is there something else that would be better?</div>
