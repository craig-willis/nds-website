    <div class="moz-cite-prefix">Matt,<br>
      <br>
      &#xC2; thanks for such a thoughtful response. I certainly don't know
      myself exactly what will work, but the focus on answers to
      specific questions in data handling sounds to me like a more
      fruitful path.<br>
      <br>
      &#xC2; To explain a bit where I'm coming from, I've recently been
      involved in the FORCE11 data citation implementation group (DCIG):<br>
      <br>
      <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://www.force11.org/datacitationimplementation">https://www.force11.org/datacitationimplementation</a><br>
      <br>
      and in particular with those looking at what it means for a
      dataset identifier to be "machine-actionable" as the "joint
      declaration" held in principle #4:<br>
      <br>
      "
      
      <span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="color:#000000;">A data
          citation should include a persistent method for identification
          that is machine actionable, globally unique, and widely used
          by a community</span><span style="font-size:10px;">"<br>
          <br>
          <br>
        </span></span>This is really on your third question, "where can
      selections of data be obtained". But maybe it feeds into the
      others as well.<br>
      <br>
      The question that came up with DCIG was, suppose you have an
      identifier for a dataset. What can an automated system reliably do
      from that point? Suppose the user goal is to load some selection
      of the data into an application - what would it take to do that
      with the least amount of further user interaction if you just
      start from the identifier?<br>
      <br>
      One consensus seemed to be the identifier (DOI, say) should
      resolve to a landing page that provides (for appropriate queries)
      some form of metadata about the dataset. There's a (in progress)
      Google spreadsheet the group has been working on here that
      compares different dataset metadata standards that are out there:<br>
      <br>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-3fjDTO3dDaRlJWSzZFYlJUZTg&amp;usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-3fjDTO3dDaRlJWSzZFYlJUZTg&amp;usp=sharing</a><br>
      <br>
      So there is some hope that metadata of this sort can be expected
      to be available after resolving a dataset identifier.<br>
      <br>
      Machine actionability then to me could imply<br>
      &#xC2;&#xC2; * application (an interoperability layer, not necessarily the
      final application for analysis) accepts identifier (eg. DOI) from
      some sort of user interaction, for example following a citation.<br>
      &#xC2;&#xC2; * application resolves DOI and receives metadata<br>
      &#xC2;&#xC2; * application could display title, date, size, format, etc. to
      user and ask for confirmation<br>
      &#xC2;&#xC2; * application may download data from "file location", unpack
      (to multiple files - a zipped "bagit" format was suggested - or
      maybe OAI-ORE)<br>
      &#xC2;&#xC2; * --- but - then what? It needs to know something more about
      the data to do anything useful with it. If there is some way for
      the data files to be linked to something like the RDA data type
      registry, then maybe at least some of it could be pulled in
      directly to the application. Or else further user interaction
      would be needed to select specific files, columns, etc??? But
      that's making it hard for the user again.<br>
      <br>
      This problem has essentially been solved for some datasets like
      IVOA with things like the VOTable standard:<br>
      <br>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/20130920/REC-VOTable-1.3-20130920.html">http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/20130920/REC-VOTable-1.3-20130920.html</a><br>
      <br>
      (along with a lot of other components). Maybe it would be helpful
      to start from there (or another example) and generalize?<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <div>Sorry it's taken me a few days to reply, but I've been
        pondering your email for a while and trying to formulate a
        response to it.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I think perhaps what I've been trying to get at in thinking
        about NDS Labs and trying to spur the conversation, is to figure
        out what's the best possible way to foster interoperability --
        specifically, what can we do, now, to create an environment to
        explore and experiment.&#xC2; I originally thought we could do this
        by providing:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Communication mechanisms</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Gradual growth and incubation of components that are
        connectable</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Simple start, complex end</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Perhaps, though, approaching this from "service discovery" is
        the wrong way.&#xC2; Adding more indirection, reimplementing things
        that have been done before -- both are tricky, like you point
        out, and probably are best to avoid for the time being.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Service discovery in general may simply be too *big* a
        sandbox for NDSLabs, where individual projects and instances
        will likely number in the handful, not the hundreds, and where
        the N^2 process of developing interoperability is going to be
        relatively small.&#xC2; If we can standardize generic k-v pairs but
        can't manage service discovery without them, we probably are
        doing something wrong! &#xC2;:)</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>So let's try what you suggested, and hammer down on what the
        specific, difficult technical things are that we want to do, and
        then figure out how to implement them.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Here are the things that for a "next gen epiphyte" I know I
        would want:</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>&#xC2;* What are the possible applications I can send input data
        to</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Where can the resultant data be sent</div>
      <div>&#xC2;* Where can selections of data be obtained</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>I'd also like to provide as much as possible in the simplest
        technology available -- which means that OAI will be a goal, but
        not the only conduit for data.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>For epiphyte, we're also taking the tactic that (for now) the
        data is all in the form of files on disk.&#xC2; This won't work
        forever, but it will for the time being.&#xC2; If we were going to
        take those three "services," I think I would want to know a
        host/port, and some format for the transmittance of data --
        perhaps even just REST posting, or a URI to a
        filesystem/filesystem-like thing.&#xC2; If we had that information it
        might be enough to provide some degree of interop at that level,
        with a basis of understanding we can build more complex ideas on
        top of later.</div>
      <div><br>
      </div>
      <div>Does that help to focus the ideas more?&#xC2; Or is this still
        complexity in search of need?</div>

              I really liked your talk about what you'd done with
              Epiphyte - in particular making hard things easy. Very
              impressive work. Is there some way to organize this by
              starting from the "hard" use cases NDS labs is trying to
              address, and drill down to the technology components
              really needed to make that happen? Discovery does seem
              likely to be a good part of it, but if it's based on
              key-value pairs (for example) how does the user know what
              keys to query, who sets the standards for those keys and
              meanings of corresponding values? Aside from knowing where
              exactly the etcd server or whatever is doing that work is.
              There's got to be some base starting point, a system that
              knows enough to help the user do things, can we work from
              there?</div>

              <div>In the other thread, Arthur brought up that we don't
                want "just another cloud infrastructure," which I think
                was really apt, and something that deserves thought for
                any NDS Labs project.&#xC2; So I wanted to start a couple
                topics about what can be provided on top of a standard
                cloud infrastructure that might be of use.</div>
              <div><br>
              </div>
              <div>I'm wondering about discovering data services within
                a region, where that region is either some subnet on a
                cloud provider, or even more globally across locations.&#xC2;
                If we are thinking about interoperability of services,
                then there are probably a few verbs that could be
                identified as being necessary.&#xC2; If we can have services
                identify themselves as providing verb endpoints, that
                could provide an environment for testing interop.</div>

              <div>Kacper and I have been experimenting with this
                ourselves, mostly looking at the various service
                discovery mechanisms that operate on docker containers
                being orchestrated across machines.&#xC2; Some of these do
                this via introspection, and some will even set up
                automatic (nginx) reverse proxies for docker containers
                running inside a system.&#xC2; Right now it looks like etcd
                is a pretty good solution for this:</div>

              <div>as it can allow for key/value pairs to be stored, and
                it's discoverable.&#xC2; For instance:</div>

                particularly etcd -- would be useful to any projects,
                and would be a good avenue for service discovery and
                intertop.&#xC2; Is there something else that would be better?</div>
