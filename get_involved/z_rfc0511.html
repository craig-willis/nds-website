                  <h2>Shared Vision of Success and Elements of an Interim Charter</h2>

		<br /><p><em><strong>This RFC is now closed.</strong></em></p>

		  <p class="lead">Through the first two NDS Consortium Workshops, we strove to rapidly discern what we want a National Data Service to be and how we can bring it about as a community-driven effort. The second workshop showed significant progress in that vision with the drafting of two key defining documents, which are presented below. These were presented to the consortium for comment in November 2014; the comment period closed Dec. 19, 2014.  Revisions were completed in January 2015.  The NDS <a href="/about/groups.html">Steering Committee</a> reviewed and further revisions were made. </p>

		<p>These latest versions will be presented to the Consortium in the <a href="/get_involved/events/NDS3/">3rd NDS Consortium Workshop</a> for final approval:</p>

		  <ul>
			<li>Document: <a href="/docs/Shared_Vision_v110.pdf">Shared Vision of Success, v1.10</a></li>
			<li>Document: <a href="/docs/NDS_Charter_v29.pdf">Elements of an Interim Charter, v2.9</a></li>
		  </ul>
