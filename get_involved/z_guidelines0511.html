                                        <p>The National Data Service refers to a modular, extensible, framework sharing and publishing research data across all disciplines of science and engineering. This data can come from individual researchers or large collaborations and projects. The data may be produced by experiments, surveys, instruments, or computer simulations, or it may represent new processing and synthesis of existing data. Such data is expected to serve as the basis for scientific results published in professional and academic journals. The NDS is expected to also provide support for sharing the models and software associated with the data and its analysis.</p>
                                        <p>The NDS will provide essential services for finding, using, sharing, and publishing data. As it will bring together many archives, libraries, federations and other data resource across many disciplines and communities, it should build on the standards and infrastructure for sharing data that being put into place by those communities. A unifying architecture for NDS will allow for numerous tools and community-specific services to not only plug into the NDS framework but also extend and enhance the NDS as it grows and matures.</p>
                                        <p>The NDS Consortium is envisioned as an alliance of communities, projects, publishers and other stakeholders that will participate in the NDS federation. Its aims are to coordinate the efforts of the participating organizations as well as inform the development and evolution of the NDS architecture.</p>
