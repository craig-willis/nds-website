					<p>This workshop is being hosted on the J.J. Pickle Research Campus of the University of Texas at Austin.  Sessions will happen in the Learning Commons building as well as in the Research Office Complex (ROC). </p>

					<p><a href="http://wiki.nationaldataservice.org/NDS3DetailedProgram">A detailed agenda is now available.</a> (<strong>agenda now includes links presenters' slides and session notes</strong>)</p>

					<p>Wednesday will host small group meetings and the NDS Labs Tutorial.  The plenary sessions <strong>begin on Thursday at 8:30am</strong> and will <strong>finish by 2pm on Friday</strong>. </p>

					<h4>NDS Labs Tutorial</h4>
					<p>On Wednesday, 10am - 12 noon, get an inside look at NDS Labs.  Bring your laptop, and you'll learn how to launch machines and services in the Labs cluster environment.  You will get an introduction to the Docker container technology and learn how you can wrap your own applications for flexible deployment in a cloud environment.  After lunch, Labs will be open for your experimentation. </p>

					<h4>Small Group Meetings</h4>
					<p>We are encouraging pilot project groups and coordinating committees to take advantage of this meeting to meet together on Wednesday in one of our small meeting rooms.  Are you involved in a NDS or RDA related project?  Contact the meeting planners via <a href="mailto:info@nationaldataservice.org">info@nationaldataservice.org</a> to reserve a room. </p>

					<h4>Plenary Sessions</h4>
					<p>The main plenary meeting will include the following sessions:</p>

					<ul>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
							<strong>Moving the National Data Service Forward</strong><br />
							We'll hear from overviews about what's been happening in the NDS as well as the community at large, including talks from:
							<ul>
								<li>Ed Seidel, chair of the Interim Steering Committee</li>
								<li>Anita de Waard on Force 11</li>
								<li>Rebecca Koskela on the Research Data Alliance</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
							<strong>Projects and Use Cases</strong><br />
							We'll report on the opening of NDS Labs and some of the early project work there. Next, we'll also get a series of lightning talks on use cases and projects from the consortium. This session will also include a discussion where we ask what new projects and applications we would like to see in NDS Labs and NDS Share.
						</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
							<strong>Building the Consortium I</strong><br />
							We'll hear a report on our latest stakeholder survey as well as be introduced to the newly elected steering committee.
						</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
							<strong>Breakout Session</strong><br />
							In this breakout, we'll explore and record key use cases, projects, and community coordination activities.
						</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
							<strong>Building the Consortium II</strong><br />
							In this session, we'll dig deeper into the needs of the community and, with your input, what it means to be member of the Consortium.  
						</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
							<strong>Working Together in the Consortium</strong><br />
							In this facilitated group discussion that will get us out of chairs, we'll work out how we should coordinate all our NDS activities and the related RDA working group activities.
						</li>
