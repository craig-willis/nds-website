					<p>We plan to address the following questions:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>What should be the function of a National Data Service?</li>
						<li>How should it be built?</li>
						<li>How do people fit in? </li>
						<li>How do we fund it?</li>

					<p>From this meeting, we plan to generate a report that will serve as a roadmap for building the NDS. </p>

					<p>We will hear from a number of representative stakeholders through both extended and lightning presentations. More importantly, though, we will have a number of break-out sessions to examine more specific questions like:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>How should the Consortium be chartered, and what does it mean to be a member?</li>
						<li>How do the perspectives, needs, and expectations of the various stakeholders align and how are they different?</li>
						<li>What are the technical requirements for an NDS?  What should the overall architecture look like?</li>
						<li>How should a cross-disciplinary service build on top of discipline- and community-specific services and infrastructure?</li>
