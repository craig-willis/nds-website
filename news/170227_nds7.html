<p>The <a href="/get_involved/events/NDS7/">seventh National Data Service Consortium workshop</a> (NDS7) will be held in Chicago on April 13-14, 2017. The workshop's theme is "Scientific Data Platforms: from Silos to Ecosystems."</p>

<p>The meeting will be located at the Hotel Allegro, a boutique hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. We have obtained a special discounted rate for accommodation at the hotel.</p>

<p>NDS7 seeks to attract participation from a broad community including researchers, developers, librarians, publishers, and others. The NDS builds on the data archiving and sharing efforts already underway within specific communities and links them together with a common set of tools designed to facilitate discovery and re-use of research data.</p>

<p>NDS7 will be co-located with <a href="https://www.globusworld.org/" target="_blank">GlobusWorld 2017 <i class="fa fa-external-link-square" title="external link"></i></a> which will be hosted on the two days prior to NDS7. GlobusWorld 2017 is focused on "Building the Research Applications and Services Ecosystem."  Co-location of NDS and GlobusWorld will enable participants to attend both meetings and facilitate the exchange of ideas between these two overlapping communities.  A joint poster session and reception will be held on Wednesday evening.</p>
