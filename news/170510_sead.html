			<p>The National Data Service (NDS) is pleased to host <a href="http://sead-data.net/" target="_blank">Sustainable Environment through Actionable Data <i class="fa fa-external-link-square" title="external link"></i></a> (SEAD) data and tools once SEAD's cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation's DataNet program concludes on June 30, 2017. The SEAD project will transition to become an NDS resource and will continue to be available to researchers for the sharing and the publication of scientific data to institutional repositories.  Members of the SEAD team are active in the NDS consortium.   For SEAD to continue as part of this emerging national infrastructure demonstrates the NDS vision that members of SEAD's leadership helped to shape. <a href="http://sead-data.net/sead-project-transition-national-data-service-consortium-resource-july-2017" target="_blank">Learn more about SEAD's transition to NDS <i class="fa fa-external-link-square" title="external link"></i></a>.</p>
 
<p>The NDS is a multi-disciplinary <a href="/about/partners.html">consortium of research computing centers, agencies, libraries, publishers and universities</a> focused on developing an open environment of data services. These services are federated, interoperable, and integrated at a national-scale with guidance from the group's stakeholders: researchers, scholars, and policy makers.  The NDS Consortium builds on data archiving and sharing efforts by connecting them together with a common set of tools to better facilitate data search, publication, linking, and reuse.</p>
