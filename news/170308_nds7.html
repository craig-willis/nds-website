<p>The <a href="/get_involved/events/NDS7/">7th National Data Service (NDS) Consortium Workshop</a> and <a href="https://www.globusworld.org/" target="_blank">GlobusWorld 2017 <i class="fa fa-external-link-square" title="external link"></i></a> are soliciting poster submissions to be presented at a joint session of the co-located NDS/GlobusWorld workshops, Chicago, April 12, 2017.</p>

<p>We encourage submissions of posters by researchers, developers, administrators, and cyberinfrastructure providers.  Topics related to either workshop are within scope with areas of particular interest including data management, scientific data platforms, research applications, research services, and the development of ecosystems.</p>

<p>Authors may submit either a draft version of their poster or a short abstract describing their poster. Submissions will be reviewed for relevance on a rolling basis. Authors can expect notification of acceptance within one week. </p>

<p>This joint poster session provides an ideal opportunity for members of the Globus and NDS communities to present and discuss related work. GlobusWorld is the annual meeting for Globus users, developers, and administrators. It focuses on addressing the data management needs of researchers irrespective of discipline. The 2017 workshop focuses on "building the research applications and services ecosystem." The NDS is an emerging vision for how scientists and researchers across all disciplines can find, reuse, and publish data. It builds on the archiving and sharing efforts already underway within specific communities and institutions and links them together with a common set of tools designed around search, publish, link and reuse capabilities.  The 2017 workshop is focused on "Scientific Data Platforms: from Silos to Ecosystems."</p>
